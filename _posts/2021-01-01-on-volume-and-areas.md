# The origin story
I am always fascinated by the origins of different mathematical facts and theorems. 
I that aspect of all the fields of research, Mathematics is the purest of all; as once a theorem is *prooved*, it remains true (unlike in say other "real world" sciences like physics
where we are kind of peeling the layers of truth, and will keep on doing so, until we find anomalies to the rules. 

In this post, we will together try to understand (or rather hypothesize, in some cases) how humans found the areas/volumes/perimeters of common geometrical objects. 
For example, the first time I learnt to "proove" sphere's volume was 4/3\pi r^3
