Hello! Welcome to my page. I am a Research Scientist at [www.wave.one](WaveOne Inc). 
Before WaveOne, I spent 5 amazing years at Stanford University, working on Data Compression and Information Theory for my PhD. 

In my spare time, I am an amateur astronomer, a recreational mathematician and an occasional musician.
